* Numerical quantities computed from a data set are called /statistics/.

* /Sample Mean/
\[\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}}}{n}\]
** Example 
The average fuel efficiencies, in miles per gallon, of cars sold in the United
States in the years 1999 to 2003 were

28.2, 28.3, 28.4, 28.5, 29.0

**  
If each data value is increased by a constant amount $c$, then this causes the
sample mean also to be increased by $c$.

\[y_{i} = x_{i} + c\]

Then

\[\bar{y} = \bar{x} + c\]
** Example
The winning scores in the U.S. Masters Golf Tournament in the years from 1981 to
1990 were as follows:

280, 284, 280, 277, 282, 279, 285, 281, 283, 278
** 
If each data value is multiplied by $c$, then so is the sample mean.

\[y_{i} = cx_{i}\]

Then

\[\bar{y} = c\bar{x}\]
** Weighted average
\[ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n f_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_i} =  \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i\]

Where

\[ w_i = \frac{f_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}} = \frac{f_{i}}{n}\]
** Example
Age of members of a symphony orchestra for young adults.

| Age | Frequency |
|-----+-----------|
|  15 |         2 |
|  16 |         5 |
|  17 |        11 |
|  18 |         9 |
|  19 |        14 |
|  20 |        13 |

** 
The /deviations/ are the differences between the data values and the sample
mean.

\[ x_{i} - \bar{x} \]

The following identity is always true

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i} - \bar{x} \right) = 0\]

** Example
Number of weeks after completion of a learn-to- drive course that it took a
sample of seven people to obtain a driver’s license.

2, 110, 5, 7, 6, 7, 3

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
/Its value is greatly affected by extreme data values./

* /Sample Median/
Order the values of a data set of size $n$ from smallest to largest. If $n$ is /odd/,
the /sample median/ is the value in position $\frac{n + 1}{2}$; if $n$ is /even/, it is the
/average/ of the values in positions $\frac{n}{2}$ and $\frac{n}{2} + 1$.


** Example
Number of weeks after completion of a learn-to- drive course that it took a
sample of seven people to obtain a driver’s license.

2, 110, 5, 7, 6, 7, 3

** Examples
Number of days it took 6 individuals to quit smoking after completing a course
designed for this purpose.

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 100

* 
The /sample mean/ makes use of /all the data/ values. 

The /sample median/ is not affected by /extreme values/.

** 
For roughly /symmetric/ data sets the sample mean and sample median will have
values /close/ to each other.

** Example
4, 6, 8, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22

** Example
A group of 5-week-old mice were each given a radiation dose of 300 rad.

[[file:img/example_2_3.png]]

* /Samples Mode/
The data value that occurs with the /greatest frequency/. 
** Examples
40 roles of a dice.

[[file:img/example_2_5.png]]

** 
If no single value occurs most frequently, then all the values that occur at
the highest frequency are called /modal values/.

* Measures of Spread
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: #f49842
:END:
* /Range/
Difference between the largest and smallest values of a data distribution.
** Example
Apple weight values

5, 6, 7, 7, 6, 8, 6, 9, 10, 8
* /Root Mean Squared (R.M.S.)/
Provides an idea of the size of the values.

\[ r.m.s.= \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{n}} \]
** Example
How small or big are this values?

0, 5, -8, 7, -3
* /Samples Variance/
Describe the spread or variability of the data values.

\[s^{2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left( x_i - \bar{x} \right)^2}{n - 1}\]
** Example
A: 3, 4, 6, 7, 10     B: -20, 5, 15, 24

** 
\[ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( x_i - \bar{x}  \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2 \]

** 
The sample variance remains unchanged when a constant is added to each data
value.

\[ y_i = x_i + c \]

Then

\[ y_i - \bar{y} = (x_i + c) - (\bar{x} + c) = x_i -\bar{x} \]

** 
If each data value is multiplied by a constant $c$ then the sample variance of
the new data is the sample variance of the old data multiplied by $c^2$.

\[y_i = cx_i\]

Then

\[s_y^2 = c^2 s_x^2\]

** Example
Worldwide number of fatal airline accidents in the years from 1997 to 2005.

[[file:img/example_2_6.png]]
* /Sample Standard Deviation/
\[s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left( x_i - \bar{x}  \right)^2}{n - 1}} = \sqrt{s^2}\]
** 
\[y_i = cx_i\]

Then

\[s_y = \left|c\right| s_x\]
* /Mean Absolute Deviation/
\[ MAD = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left| x_i - \bar{x} \right|}{n}  \]

** SD vs MAD
 - SD > MAD
 - MAD is easier to understand
 - SD is easier to work with
 - SD is more widely used

* /Sample Percentiles/
The sample $100p$ percentile is that data value such that at least $100p$
percent of the data are less than or equal to it and at least $100(1 − p)$
percent are greater than or equal to it. If two data values satisfy this
condition, then the sample $100p$ percentile is the arithmetic average of these
two values.

** 
To find the sample $100p$ percentile of a data set of size $n$
 1. Arrange the data in increasing order.
 2. If $np$ is not an integer, determine the smallest integer greater than $np$. The data
    value in that position is the sample $100p$ percentile.
 3. If $np$ is an integer, then the average of the values in positions $np$ and
    $np + 1$ is the sample 100p percentile.

** Example
Which data value is the sample 90th percentile when the sample size is (a) 8,
(b) 16, and (c) 100?

** Quartiles
 - The sample /25th percentile/ is called the /first quartile/.
 -  The sample /50th percentile/ is called the /median/ or the /second quartile/.
 -  The sample /75th/ percentile is called the /third quartile/.

The quartiles break up a data set into four parts.

** Example
36 noise levels outside of Grand Central Station in Manhattan in dB.

* /Interquartile range/
3rd quartile - 1st quartile

Length of the /interval/ in which the middle /half of the data/ values lie.
** Example

** Box Plot
[[file:img/box-plot.png]]
# * /Chebyshev's Inequality/
# For any value of $k \geq 1$; greater than 

# \[ 100(1 − \frac{1}{k^2}) \] 

# percent of the data lie within the interval 

# \[(\bar{x} − ks,\bar{x} +ks)\]
# ** 
#  - $k=1.5$: 55.6% of the data lies within $1.5s$ from the mean.
#  - $k=2$: 75% of the data lies within $2s$ from the mean.
#  - $k=3$: 88.9% of the data lies within $3s$ from the mean.
# ** Proof
#  - Start with $(n-1)s^2$
* Normal Data Sets
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

** Definition
A data set is said to be normal if a histogram describing it has the following
properties:
 - It is highest at the middle interval.
 - Moving from the middle interval in either direction, the height decreases in
   such a way that the entire histogram is bell-shaped.
 - The histogram is symmetric about its middle interval.
** Normal data set
[[file:img/nomal-hist.png]]
** Skewed to the right
[[file:img/right-skewed-hist.png]]
** Skewed to the left
[[file:img/left-skewed-hist.png]]
** Empirical rule
 - Approximately /68%/ of the observations lie within /$\bar{x} \pm s$/
 - Approximately /95%/ of the observations lie within /$\bar{x} \pm 2s$/
 - Approximately /99.7%/ of the observations lie within /$\bar{x} \pm 3s$/

** Example
Scores on a statistics exam

** Bimodal data sets
A data set that is obtained by sampling from a population that is itself made up
of subpopulations.

\[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2\pi}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}dx = 1\]

* Sets of paired data

\[(x_i,y_i)\]

[[file:img/table_2-12.png]]
** Scatter diagram
[[file:img/fig_2_13.png]]

\[r = 0.4189 \]
** Sample Correlation Coefficient
\[ r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{(n-1) s_x s_y} \]

\[ r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n
(x_i-\bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar{y})^2}} \]

** Properties of r
 - $-1 \leq r \leq 1$
 - If for constants $a$ and $b$, $y_i = a + bx_i$ then:
   - $r=1$ if $b>0$
   - $r=-1$ if $b<0$
 - $r(x_i,y_i) = r(a + bx_i, c + dy_i)$ if $sign(b) = sign(d)$
** 
 - $\left|r\right| = 1$ means a perfect linear relationship between data
 - $\left|r\right| < 1$ gives the strength of the correlation
 - $sign(r)$ gives the direction of the correlation.

** 
[[file:img/fig_2_14b.png]]
** Example
Resting pulse rates (in beats per minute) and the years of schooling of 10
individuals. ($r = -0.7639$)

[[file:img/example_2_8.png]]

[[file:img/fig_2_15b.png]]

** Proof
 - Start with $\sum\left( \frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{s_x} - \frac{y_i-\bar{y}}{s_y}
   \right)^2 \geq 0$
** Correlation measures association, not causation
Often, the explanation for such an association lies with an unexpressed factor
that is related to both variables under consideration.
