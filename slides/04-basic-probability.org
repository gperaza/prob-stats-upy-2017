* Definition
An /experiment/ is any process that produces an observation or /outcome/. The set of
all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the /sample space $S$/.

** Examples
** The gender of a child.
\[ S = \left\{ g, b \right\}\]
** Flipping two coins
\[ S = \left\{ (H,H),(H,T),(T,H),(T,T)\right\}\]
** Order of finish in a race among 7 horses
\[ S = \left\{ \text{all permutations of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7} \right\}\]
** Rolling two six-sided dice
\[ \begin{split}
S = \left\{ (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6),\\
 (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6),\\
 (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6),\\
 (4, 1), (4, 2),(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6),\\
 (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6),\\
 (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6) \right\}
 \end{split} \]

* Definition
Any set of outcomes of the experiment is called an /event/. We designate events by
the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, and so on. We say that the event $A$ /occurs/ whenever
the outcome is contained in $A$.

** Examples
** The gender of a child.
\[ S = \left\{ g, b \right\}\]
 - $A=\{g\}$ is the event that the child is a girl.
 - $B=\{b\}$ is the event that the child is a boy.
** Flipping two coins
\[ S = \left\{ (H,H),(H,T),(T,H),(T,T)\right\}\]
 - $A = \{(H, H), (H, T)\}$ is the event that the first coin lands on heads.
** Order of finish in a race among 7 horses
\[ S = \left\{ \text{all permutations of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7} \right\}\]
 - $A = \{\text{all outcomes in S starting with 2}\}$ is the event that horse
   number 2 wins the race.
** Rolling two six-sided dice
\[ \begin{split}
S = \left\{ (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6),\\
 (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6),\\
 (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6),\\
 (4, 1), (4, 2),(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6),\\
 (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6),\\
 (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6) \right\}
 \end{split} \]
 - $A = \{(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)\}$ is the event that
   the sum of the dice is 7
* Union of events
\[A \cup B\]

** Examples
** The gender of a child.
\[ S = \left\{ g, b \right\}\]
 - $A=\{g\}$ is the event that the child is a girl.
 - $B=\{b\}$ is the event that the child is a boy.

 - $A\cup B = \{g,b\} = S$
** Order of finish in a race among 7 horses
 - $A = \{\text{all outcomes starting with 4}\}$
 - $B = \{\text{all outcomes in with seconf element equal to 2}\}$

 - $A\cup B$ is the event that either the number 4 horse wins or the number 2
   horse comes in second or both.

* Intersection of events
\[A \cap B\]

[[file:img/venn-intersection.png]]
** Examples
** Flipping two coins
\[ S = \left\{ (H,H),(H,T),(T,H),(T,T)\right\}\]
 - $A = \{(H, H), (H, T)\}$ is the event that the first coin lands on heads.
 - $B = \{(H, T, (T, T)\}$ is the event that the second coin lands on tails.

 - $A \cap B = \{H,T\}$

** Order of finish in a race among 7 horses
 - $A = \{\text{all outcomes starting with 2}\}$
 - $B = \{\text{all outcomes starting with 3}\}$

 - $A \cap B = \emptyset$ is the /null event/ or /empty set/.

** Disjoint or mutually exclusive events
\[ A\cap B = \emptyset\]

[[file:img/disjoint.png]]
* Complement
All outcomes in the sample space that are not in $A$.

[[file:img/SetComplement.png]]

\[ A^{c} \]

\[ S^{c} = \emptyset \]

** Example: Gender of a child.
\[ S = \left\{ g, b \right\}\]

 - $A=\{g\}$ is the event that the child is a girl.

 - $A^{c} = \{b\}$
* Properties of probability
For each event $A$ there is a number, denoted $P(A)$ and called the /probability/
of event $A$.

 - $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
 - $P(S) = 1$
 - $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

$P(A)$ is the /long run frequency/ of event A.

** Addition rule of probability
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

** Probability of the complement
\[ P(A^{c}) = 1 - P(A) \]
** Examples
** 
A certain retail establishment accepts either the American Express or the VISA
credit card. A total of 22 percent of its customers carry an American Express
card, 58 percent carry a VISA credit card, and 14 percent carry both. What is
the probability that a customer will have at least one of these cards?

** Tossing a coin and roll of a die
[[file:Sup-1-coin-dice.html][An R simulation.]]
* Equiprobability
Some processes are expected to have equally likely outcomes (coin, dice, etc.).
\[ S = \{1,2,\ldots,N\}\]

\[ P(\{1\}=P(\{2\})=\cdots=P(\{N\}) \]

** Then

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of outcoms in S that are in A}}{N}  \]

** Examples
** 
In a survey of 420 members of a retirement center, it was found that 144 are
smokers and 276 are not. If a member is selected in such a way that each of the
members is equally likely to be the one selected, what is the probability that
person is a smoker?
** 
Suppose that when two dice are rolled, each of the 36 possible outcomes is
equally likely. Find the probability that the sum of the dice is 6 and that it
is 7.
** 
One man and one woman are to be selected from a group that consists of 10
married couples. If all possible selections are equally likely, what is the
probability that the woman and man selected are married to each other?
** 
An elementary school is offering two optional language classes, one in French
and the other in Spanish. These classes are open to any of the 120 upper-grade
students in the school. Suppose there are 32 students in the French class, 36 in
the Spanish class, and a total of 8 who are in both classes. If an upper-grade
student is randomly chosen, what is the probability that this student is
enrolled in at least one of these classes?
* Conditional probability
If some partial information concerning the outcome of the experiment is
available we have /conditional probabilities/.

** 
The conditional probability of $B$ given that $A$ has occurred:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}  \]

[[file:img/venn-intersection.png]]

** Examples
** 
As a further check of the preceding formula for the conditional probability, use
it to compute the conditional probability that the sum of a pair of rolled dice
is 10, given that the first die lands on 4.
** 
The organization that employs Jacobi is organizing a parent-daughter dinner for
those employees having at least one daughter. Each of these employees is asked
to attend along with one of his or her daughters. If Jacobi is known to have two
children, what is the conditional probability that they are both girls given
that Jacobi is invited to the dinner? Assume the sample space S is given by

\[S = \{(g, g), (g, b), (b, g), (b, b)\}\]

and that all these outcomes are equally likely, where the outcome (g, b) means,
for instance, that Jacobi’s oldest child is a girl and youngest is a boy.
** Multiplication rule

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B|A)  \]
** Examples
** 
Suppose that two people are randomly chosen from a group of 4 women and
6 men.
 a. What is the probability that both are women?
 b. What is the probability that one is a woman and the other a man?
** Independent events
Events A and B are /independent/ if

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B) \]

Note that this means

\[ P(B|A) = P(B) \]

** Examples
** 
Suppose that we roll a pair of fair dice, so each of the 36 possible outcomes is
equally likely. Let A denote the event that the first die lands on 3, let B be
the event that the sum of the dice is 8, and let C be the event that the sum of
the dice is 7.

a. Are A and B independent?
b. Are A and C independent?
** 
A couple is planning on having three children. Assuming that each child is
equally likely to be of either sex and that the sexes of the children are
independent, find the probability that

a. All three children will be girls.
b. At least one child will be a girl.
* Bayes' theorem
H is the event a hypothesis is true.
E is evidence concerning the hypothesis.

\[  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|H^{c})P(H^{c})} \]
** Proof
Consider the following equation
\[ P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|B^c)P(B^c)\]

By the definition of conditional probability

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(H \cap E)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Combining both equations gives us Bayes' theorem.

** Examples
** 
An insurance company believes that people can be divided into two classes— those
who are prone to have accidents and those who are not. The data indicate that an
accident-prone person will have an accident in a 1-year period with probability
0.1; the probability for all others is 0.05. Suppose that the probability is 0.2
that a new policyholder is accident-prone.

a. What is the probability that a new policyholder will have an accident in the
   first year?
b. If a new policyholder has an accident in the first year, what is the
   probability that he or she is accident-prone?
** 
A blood test is 99 percent effective in detecting a certain disease when the
dis- ease is present. However, the test also yields a false-positive result for
2 percent of the healthy patients tested. (That is, if a healthy person is
tested, then with probability 0.02 the test will say that this person has the
disease.) Suppose 0.5 percent of the population has the disease. Find the
conditional probability that a randomly tested individual actually has the
disease given that his or her test result is positive.

* Counting principles
/Basic principle of counting/: 

Suppose an experiment consists of two parts. If /part 1/ can result in any of /n/
possible outcomes and if for each outcome of part 1 there are /m/ possible
outcomes of /part 2/, then there is a total of /nm/ possible outcomes of the
experiment.
** Examples
** 
One man and one woman are to be selected from a group consisting of 12 women and
8 men. How many different choices are possible?
** 
Two people are to be selected from a group that consists of 10 married couples.
How many different choices are possible? If each choice is equally likely, what
is the probability that the two people selected are married to each other?
** Generalized Basic Principle of Counting
Suppose an experiment consists of /r/ parts. Suppose there are /$n_1$/ possible
outcomes of part 1 and then /$n_2$/ possible outcomes of part 2 and then /$n_3$/
possible outcomes of part 3, and so on. Then there is a total of $n_1 \cdot n_2
\cdots n_r$ possible outcomes of the experiment.
** Permutation of n objects
\[ n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdots 3\cdot 2\cdot 1\]
** Examples
** 
If four people are in a room, what is the probability that no two of them
celebrate their birthday on the same day of the year?
** Combination of n objects taken r at a time
\[ \binom n r = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!r!}\]
** Examples
** 
a. How many different groups of size 2 can be selected from the items a, b, c?
b. How many different groups of size 2 can be chosen from a set of 6 people?
c. How many different groups of size 3 can be chosen from a set of 6 people?
** 
A random sample of size 3 is to be selected from a set of 10 items. What is the
probability that a prespecified item will be selected?
** 
A committee of 4 people is to be selected from a group of 5 men and 7 women.  If
the selection is made randomly, what is the probability the committee will
consist of 2 men and 2 women?
** Symmetry
\[ \binom nr = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!r!} = \binom n {n - r}\]
** Examples
** 
Compare $\binom 8 5$ and $\binom {12} {10}$.
** 
Suppose that n + m digits, n of which are equal to 1 and m of which are equal to
0, are to be arranged in a linear order. How many different arrangements are
possible? For instance, if n = 2 and m = 1, then there are 3 possible
arrangements:

\[1, 1, 0 \quad  1, 0, 1 \quad   0, 1, 1\]
