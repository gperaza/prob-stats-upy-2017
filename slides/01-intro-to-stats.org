* An introductory case
Is it better for children to start school at a younger or older age?

* What does data tells us?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
 - Older students fare better in tests applied at the end of the first year.
 - Why?
 - Can we gather more significant data?

#+REVEAL: split

* Definition of statistics
The art of /learning from data/. It is concerned with the collection of data,
their subsequent description, and their analysis, which often leads to the
drawing of conclusions.

* DATA
 - Collecting
 - Organizing
 - Analyzing
 - Interpreting

* The raw material of statistics is /DATA/
* DATA?
* Data in statistics
In statistics, "Data" is conceptualized as having /objects/ on which we observe or
measure one or more /characteristics/.

* 
Objects -> Individuals
 
Characteristics -> Variables

* Why variables 
A characteristics that /varies/ from one individual to another.

* 
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
/individuals/
 - observations
 - subjects
 - objects
 - cases
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div> 

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width: 50%">
/variables/
 - characteristics
 - attributes
 - features
 - traits
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div> 

* /Variables/ play the starring role in statistical studies
* 
Given an object (individual)

What variables (characteristics) can you think about?

* How would you change a /quantitative/ variables into a /qualitative/ one?
**  
Converting temperature into a qualitative variables

**  
| Cold   | Mild   | Hot        |
| < 5 ºC | 5 - 25 | ºC > 25 ºC |

* How would you change a /qualitative/ variables into a /quantitative/ one?

Switching to quantitative variables

Frequency of usage
 - never
 - rarely
 - sometimes
 - often

* More about quantitative variables
/Continuous/

/Discrete/
* Discrete Quantitative Variables
Takes only a finite number of values or a /countable/ number of values.
** Discrete Quantitative Variables
 - Number of days in a year
 - Number of laps you can swim in 5 minutes
 - Number of goals in the FIFA World Cup
* Continuous Quantitative Variable
Takes on any of the /countless/ number of values in a line interval
** Continuous Quantitative Variable
 - Time to run 100 meters
 - Distance while running 30 minutes
 - Size of a text file
* Two types of statistics
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t) 
 - /Descriptive statistics/: The part of statistics concerned with the description
   and summarization of data.
 - /Inferential statistics/: The part of statistics concerned with the drawing of
   conclusions from data.

* Data collection
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
 - Existing data sets: government, institutions, etc. Examples:
   - INEGI: http://www.inegi.org.mx/
   - World bank open data: http://data.worldbank.org/
 - Collecting new data from experiments. Examples:
   - Surveys
   - Measurements

* Example
Design an experiment to test a new drug.
** Variables of interest
** Unknown variables
** Reducing influence of unknowns
 - Control group
 - Random sampling
* How sure are we that the results are real?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
 - We need to take into account the influence of chance.
** Think about a coin
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
 - 7 heads out of 10 flips
 - 47 heads out of 50 flips
** Probability models
 - Assumptions about the chances (probabilities).
* Population
The total collection of all the elements that we are interested in.
** Sample
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
 - A subgroup of the population that we study in detail.
 - Must be /representative/ about the population.
 - It is /always/ an approximation.
 - How do we choose a sample?
** Random sampling
A /sample/ of /k/ members of a population is said to be a /random sampling/ if the
members are chosen in such a way that all possible choices of the /k/ members are
equally likely.

** Conclusion from the data are always exact for the sample, but never for the population.

** Stratified random sampling
